# JavaScript for the Calculator

This line declares a constant variable named display and uses the document.querySelector method to select the element with the ID of display from the HTML document. This element is most likely an input field used to display the results of a calculator.

```
const display = document.querySelector("#display");
```

This line declares another constant variable named buttons and uses the document.querySelectorAll method to select all the button elements from the HTML document. These button elements are most likely the buttons used to input numbers and operators in the calculator.

```
const buttons = document.querySelectorAll("button");
```

This line uses the forEach method to loop through all the button elements selected in the previous line, and for each button element it will perform the following actions:

```
buttons.forEach((btn) => {
```

This line adds an event listener to each button element, listening for a click event. When a click event occurs, it will perform the following actions:

```
btn.addEventListener("click", () => {
```

This line checks if the id property of the clicked button element is equal to =. If it is, it will perform the following action:

```
if (btn.id === "=") {
```

This line evaluates the mathematical expression entered in the display input field using the eval() function and sets the result as the value of the display input field.

```
display.value = eval(display.value);
```

This line checks if the id property of the clicked button element is equal to ac. If it is, it will perform the following action:

```
} else if (btn.id === "ac"){
```

This line clears the value of the display input field by setting it to an empty string.


```
display.value=" ";
```

This line checks if the id property of the clicked button element is equal to de. If it is, it will perform the following action:

```
}else if (btn.id === "de"){
```

This line removes the last character from the value of the display input field using the slice() method.

```
display.value =  display.value.slice(0,-1);
```

If the clicked button element's id is not equal to = or ac or de, it means that it must be a number or operator button, so it will perform the following action:

```
} else{
```

This line appends the id property of the clicked button element to the current value of the display input field, effectively adding the clicked number or operator to the current expression being evaluated.

```
display.value += btn.id;
```

Finally, these two closing brackets close the forEach loop and the event listener function, respectively.

```
})
})
